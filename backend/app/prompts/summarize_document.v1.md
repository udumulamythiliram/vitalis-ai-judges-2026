```

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a markdown summary following this structure:
### Key Takeaway
One or two warm, empowering sentences explaining what this document is about.

### What Your Record Shows
Bullet points summarizing confirmed facts, medications, or test results. Preserve all drug names, numbers, and units exactly.

### Values Outside Printed Range (if applicable)

RULES:
- Ground every statement ONLY in the provided record data.
- NEVER diagnose a condition or propose changing/stopping medications.

- If reading level is simple or elderly mode is active, use short sentences, avoid jargon, and maintain a comforting, respectful tone.
