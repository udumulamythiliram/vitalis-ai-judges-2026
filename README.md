# Vitalis AI — Your Personal Health Copilot
### Master Build for ByteXL AI Tools Hackathon (Altrix Labs Challenge)

> **"Upload any medical document. Understand it in your language, at your level. Ask anything. Walk into the doctor's office prepared."**

Vitalis AI is an end-to-end, fully functional personal health companion built for elderly individuals, children (via guardians), caregivers, chronic condition patients, and everyday users. It replaces scattered papers with a unified, verified health timeline backed by real OCR, deterministic clinical rule validation, and a multi-provider LLM gateway.

## 1. Quickstart (< 5 Commands)

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate | On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
API runs at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`** (Swagger docs at **`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`**).

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Web app runs at **`http://127.0.0.1:5173`**.

### Public judge demo

The Vercel deployment serves the React app and FastAPI API from one origin. The frontend uses `/api` requests; Vite proxies those requests to the local FastAPI server during development.

The public judge build uses fictional seeded personas and a shared temporary workspace. Use fictional or de-identified documents only. Judge uploads are limited to 3 MB and are processed once for an OCR/text preview without saving the uploaded file or its extracted text to the database. If a judge explicitly requests a live summary or copilot answer, the selected provider receives the submitted text and the judge's own API key; the key is held in browser-tab memory and is not saved by Vitalis. Provider usage may incur charges. Demo chats and other changes without a judge key can be visible to other visitors and may reset when the server instance changes. The serverless SQLite database uses temporary runtime storage, so this build is for hackathon evaluation, not durable production use.

To deploy the combined app, set the Vercel project root directory to the repository root and deploy this folder. Vercel detects `index.py` as the FastAPI entrypoint, installs `requirements.txt`, and runs the frontend build in `vercel.json`.

## 6. Ten-Slide Hackathon Presentation Kit

- **Slide 1: Title & Vision** — Vitalis AI: The Personal Health Copilot that turns scattered medical records into one verified, understandable timeline.
- **Slide 2: Problem & Healthcare Fragmentation** — 80% of patients forget doctor instructions; test reports are filled with opaque numbers; handwriting is unreadable.
- **Slide 3: Real OCR & Ingestion Pipeline** — PyMuPDF text extraction + PIL preprocessing + SHA256 duplicate prevention.
